# Comments in JavaScript

In JavaScript, there are **two types of comments**:

---

### ✅ **1. Single-line Comment**

Use `//` to comment a single line.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // This is an inline comment
```

---

### ✅ **2. Multi-line (Block) Comment**

Use `/* ... */` to comment across multiple lines.

```javascript
/* This is a multi-line comment
   It can span several lines */
let y = 10;
```

---

### ⚠️ Notes:

* Comments are ignored by the JavaScript engine and are useful for explaining code or disabling lines temporarily.
* Use comments meaningfully — avoid over-commenting obvious code.
