**how JavaScript works** under the hood—especially in the **browser**—is crucial for mastering the language. Here's a clear breakdown of how JavaScript is executed and what happens behind the scenes.

## 🔍 **1. What Happens When You Run JavaScript in a Browser**

When you load a web page that includes JavaScript:

1. The **HTML file** is loaded by the browser.
2. As it parses the HTML, it encounters `<script>` tags.
3. The browser sends the JavaScript code to its **JavaScript engine** to be executed.
4. The engine interprets or compiles the code into machine code and runs it.

## ⚙️ **2. JavaScript Engine Overview**

Each browser has its own JavaScript engine:

* **Chrome** → V8
* **Firefox** → SpiderMonkey
* **Safari** → JavaScriptCore (Nitro)
* **Edge** → Chakra (Old), now also V8 (Chromium-based)

### Engine Components:

* **Parser**: Reads and parses JavaScript code, generating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
* **Interpreter**: Quickly runs code line-by-line (e.g., V8's older *Ignition*).
* **Compiler**: Optimizes and compiles code into machine code (e.g., V8’s *TurboFan*).
* **Garbage Collector**: Frees memory by removing unused variables and objects.

## ⏱️ **3. JavaScript is Single-Threaded**

JavaScript runs on a **single thread**, meaning it processes one operation at a time. But it *feels* asynchronous thanks to:

### The **Event Loop** System:

1. **Call Stack**: Executes functions in order. If one function calls another, it’s added to the top of the stack.
2. **Web APIs**: Provided by the browser (not JS itself). They handle timers, DOM events, AJAX/fetch, etc.
3. **Callback Queue (Task Queue)**: Stores async callbacks (e.g., from `setTimeout`, `fetch`) to be added to the stack once it’s clear.
4. **Event Loop**: Constantly checks if the call stack is empty and pushes queued tasks onto it.

📝 Example:

```js
console.log("1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2");
}, 0);

console.log("3");
```

**Output:**

```
1
3
2
```

Why? Because `setTimeout` goes to the Web API and then to the task queue, and it runs only after the main stack is clear.

## 🧩 **4. Key Concepts and Terms**

| Term               | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Call Stack**     | Where the browser keeps track of function calls              |
| **Web API**        | Browser features accessible to JS (e.g., DOM, fetch, timers) |
| **Event Loop**     | A loop that checks the call stack and the task queue         |
| **Callback Queue** | Holds async callbacks until the call stack is empty          |
| **Heap**           | Memory space where objects are stored                        |

## 🔚 Summary

* JavaScript runs inside the browser’s **JavaScript engine** (like V8).
* It’s **single-threaded** but asynchronous via **Web APIs**, **event loop**, and **callback queue**.
* Understanding this helps with debugging, performance optimization, and writing better asynchronous code.
